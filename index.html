This closed-design paradigm has limited the capability of the switches to proprietary implementations which are hard-coded by vendors, inducing a lengthy, costly, and inflexible process. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention from both the research community and the industry, permitting operators and programmers in general to run customized packet processing functions. This open-design paradigm is paving the way for an unprecedented wave of innovation and experimentation by reducing the time of designing, testing, and adopting new protocols; enabling a customized, top-down approach to develop network applications; providing granular visibility of packet events defined by the programmer; reducing complexity and enhancing resource utilization of the programmable switches; and drastically improving the performance of applications that are offloaded to the data plane. Despite the impressive advantages of programmable data plane switches and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides a background encompassing an overview of the evolution of networks from legacy to programmable, describing the essentials of programmable switches, and summarizing their advantages over Software-defined Networking (SDN) and legacy devices. The paper then presents a unique, comprehensive taxonomy of applications developed with P4 language; surveying, classifying, and analyzing more than 200 articles; discussing challenges and considerations; and presenting future perspectives and open research issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/hsn.png"></div> <div id="crichigno2022high" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">High-Speed Networks, A Tutorial</div> <div class="author"> Jorge Crichigno, Elie Kfoury, Elias Bou-Harb, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

This book is the result of a journey of the authors who have been designing and deploying high-speed networks for several years, in particular Science Demilitarized Zones (Science DMZs). The Science DMZ is a high-speed network designed to facilitate the transfer of big science data. As the popularity of high-speed networks and Science DMZs surged, the need for professionals with the skills to operate such infrastructures has increased. How- ever, practitioners have been mostly trained to operate general-purpose networks, which have different characteristics from those of Science DMZs and other high- performance networks. At the time when the authors started designing and operating Science DMZs, the available material was limited to workshops organized by ESnet, the Scientific Networking Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States (U.S.). This book tries to address the above gap. It provides practical knowledge and skills on Science DMZs and high-speed networks in general, which are reinforced with virtual laboratory experiments</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/bbr2-elie.png"></div> <div id="kfoury2020emulation" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An Emulation-based Evaluation of TCP BBRv2 Alpha for Wired Broadband</div> <div class="author"> Elie F Kfoury, Jose Gomez, Jorge Crichigno, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Since then, BBR has gained a widespread attention due to its ability to operate efficiently in the presence of packet loss and in scenarios where routers are equipped with small buffers. These characteristics were not attainable with traditional loss-based congestion control algorithms such as CUBIC and Reno. BBRv2 is a recent congestion control algorithm proposed as an improvement to its predecessor, BBRv1. Preliminary work suggests that BBRv2 maintains the high throughput and the bounded queueing delay properties of BBRv1. However, the literature has been missing an evaluation of BBRv2 under different network conditions. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of BBRv2 Alpha (v2alpha-2019-07-28) on Mininet, considering alternative active queue management (AQM) algorithms, routers with different buffer sizes, variable packet loss rates and round-trip times (RTTs), and small and large numbers of TCP flows. Emulation results show that BBRv2 tolerates much higher random packet loss rates than loss-based algorithms but slightly lower than BBRv1. The results also confirm that BBRv2 has better coexistence with loss-based algorithms and lower retransmission rates than BBRv1, and that it produces low queuing delay even with large buffers. When a Tail Drop policy is used with large buffers, an unfair bandwidth allocation is observed among BBRv2 and CUBIC flows. Such unfairness can be reduced by using advanced AQM schemes such as FQ-CoDel and CAKE. Regarding fairness among BBRv2 flows, results show that using small buffers produces better fairness, without compromising high throughput and link utilization. This observation applies to BBRv1 flows as well, which suggests that rate-based model-based algorithms work better with small buffers. BBRv2 also enhances the coexistence of flows with different RTTs, mitigating the RTT unfairness problem noted in BBRv1. Lastly, the paper presents the advantages of using TCP pacing with a loss-based algorithm, when the rate is manually configured a priori. Future algorithms could set the pacing rate using explicit feedback generated by modern programmable switches.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/pcp.png"></div> <div id="kfoury2019decentralized" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decentralized Distribution of PCP Mappings over Blockchain for End-to-end Secure Direct Communications</div> <div class="author"> Elie F Kfoury, Jose Gomez, Jorge Crichigno, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Traversing the NAT device remains a challenge for a wide range of applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT). The Port Control Protocol (PCP) is a relatively new protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to solve the NAT traversal issues. It allows a NATed device to request and manage a mapping between its private IP address and transport-layer port to a public IP address and port. As PCP requires an application-dependent method for distributing the mappings to remote hosts, several attacks can target the distributing server and render the communication channel vulnerable. In this paper, we propose and implement a decentralized Blockchain-based approach for distributing PCP-mappings, enabling secure end-to-end (e2e) direct communications without any trusted third party server. NATed devices register their PCP mappings and public keys into the Blockchain, and other peers can then learn about these mappings to establish end-to-end secure direct communications. The implementation verifies that the system is feasible in terms of transactions fees, can simplify and secure end-to-end direct communications, and can interwork with conventional security methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/buffer_globecome.png"></div> <div id="kfoury2021dynamic" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dynamic Router’s Buffer Sizing using Passive Measurements and P4 Programmable Switches</div> <div class="author"> Elie Kfoury, Jorge Crichigno, Elias Bou-Harb, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Network operators nowadays configure the router’s buffer size manually and stati-cally. They typically configure large buffers that fill up and never go empty, increasing the Round-trip Time (RTT) of packets significantly and decreasing the application performance. Few works in the literature dynamically adjust the buffer size, but are implemented only in simulators, and therefore cannot be tested and deployed in production networks with real traffic. Previous work suggested setting the buffer size to the Bandwidth-delay Product (BDP) divided by the square root of the number of long flows. Such formula is adequate when the RTT and the number of long flows are known in advance. This paper proposes a system that leverages programmable switches as passive instruments to measure the RTT and count the number of flows traversing a legacy router. Based on the measurements, the programmable switch dynamically adjusts the buffer size of the legacy router in order to mitigate the unnecessary large queuing delays. Results show that when the buffer is adjusted dynamically, the RTT, the loss rate, and the fairness among long flows are enhanced. Additionally, the Flow Completion Time (FCT) of short flows sharing the queue is greatly improved. The system can be adopted in campus, enterprise, and service provider networks, without the need to replace legacy routers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%65%6B%66%6F%75%72%79@%65%6D%61%69%6C.%73%63.%65%64%75" title="email"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8OCOYCEAAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fas fa-rss-square"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> The best way to reach me is through my email ekfoury at email.sc.edu. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Elie F.
