        - Ericsson Startup Challenge
        - Ericsson Garage has launched this competition in cooperation with Capital A Partners (CAP A), and Butterfly Ventures. I was the lead developer as part of Secumobi AB, a Swedish startup specialized in IoT, systems security and Blockchain technology. The project was among the nine finalists from the 189 startup participation forms received. The nine startups were selected to pitch their ideas in front of a live Dragons Den (a jury of specialized experts) which included B ̈orje Ekholm, the CEO of Ericsson, at the Ericsson Studio in collaboration with the STHLM TechFest. Secumobi AB won the second prize, which included one hour of mentoring and investments with Cap A or Butterfly, as well as free access to run the project and test it in the Urban ICT Arena in Stockholm, Sweden for three months (2017).
