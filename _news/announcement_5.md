I had a great time attending the FABRIC KNIT6 Workshop at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). I delivered two unconference sessions: 1) Workshop on Writing Security Applications with P4 Programmable Data Plane Switches; 2) Evaluating BBRv2 Congestion Control Algorithm on FABRIC. Both sessions were well received by the audience. Thank you to everyone involved for making this such a valuable experience! [Link](https://fabric-testbed.net/events/knit-6)
