  abstract={Ever since the inception of the networking industry, routing and switching devices have been limited to tightly-coupled hardware and software components. Vendors provide closed source proprietary stacks, restraining network operators from utilizing customized features, and hence hindering innovation. This aggregated model is costly, time consuming, and unscalable as changes in the devices require vendor's intervention. As a result, the industry started manufacturing white-box switches and developing Network Operating Systems (NOSs) that support multiple vendors and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This model is referred to as ”disaggregated” as the software and hardware are decoupled; essentially, vendors' switching silicons (e.g., Broadcom) are compatible with different NOS (e.g., SONiC). In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned while designing and implementing a testbed that consists of disaggregated network devices. We iterate over several open source Internet Protocol (IP) routing suites and NOSs that are vendor-agnostic. Additionally, we highlight a novel type of forwarding data planes that are programmable and explore their features. The testbed consists of two white-box switches provided by Edgecore that use programmable switching silicon (Tofino) manufactured by Barefoot Networks, an Intel Company. We installed SONiC NOS on top of the switches and tested static and BGP routing protocols. We report the configuration process and the prerequisites needed to deploy a working disaggregated environment. Finally, we discuss how open source NOSs and programmable switches can be extended to support campus networks, rather than being data center-oriented only.}

  abstract={Previous studies have observed that TCP pacing evenly spacing out packets-minimizes traffic burstiness, reduces packet losses, and increases throughput. However, the main drawback of pacing is that the number of flows and the bottleneck link capacity must be known in advance. With this information, pacing is achieved by manually tuning sender nodes to send at rates that aggregate to the bottleneck capacity. This paper proposes a scheme based on programmable switches by which rates are dynamically adjusted. These switches store the network's state in the data plane and notify sender nodes to update their pacing rates when the network's state changes, e.g., a new flow joins or leaves the network. The scheme uses a custom protocol that is encapsulated inside the IP Options header field and thus is compatible with legacy switches (i.e., the scheme does not require all switches to be programmable). Furthermore, the processing overhead at programmable switches is minimal, as custom packets are only generated when a flow joins or leaves the network. Simulation results conducted in Mininet demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of dynamically notifying hosts to adapt the pacing rate with a minimum delay, increasing throughput, mitigating the TCP sawtooth behavior, and achieving better fairness among concurrent flows. The proposed scheme and preliminary results are particularly attractive to applications such as Science DMZ, where typically a small number of large flows must share the bandwidth capacity.}

  abstract={According to estimations, approximately 80% of Internet traffic represents media traffic. Much of it is generated by end users communicating with each other (e.g., voice, video sessions). A key element that permits the communication of users that may be behind Network Address Translation (NAT) is the relay server. This paper presents a scheme for offloading media traffic from relay servers to programmable switches. The proposed scheme relies on the capability of a P4 switch with a customized parser to de-encapsulate and process packets carrying media traffic. The switch then applies multiple switch actions over the packets. As these actions are simple and collectively emulate a relay server, the scheme is capable of moving relay functionality to the data plane operating at terabits per second. Performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme not only produces optimal results regarding Quality of Service (QoS) parameters (no packet loss, minimum delay, negligible delay variation, high Mean Opinion Score) but also scales much better than current solutions. Evaluations conducted with up to 35Gbps of media traffic or its equivalent of 400,000 simultaneous G.711 media sessions (limited only by the traffic generator rather than by the switch) show an ideal operation of the switch-based solution (using∼l% of the switching capacity). In contrast, a relay server with a modern CPU model used for evaluations can process up to 900 simultaneous G.711 media sessions per core.}
