I am Elie Kfoury, a PhD student in the College of Engineering and Computing at the University of South Carolina.

Research in computer networks and cybersecurity using optimization and algorithmic techniques is very attractive to me. The research I am conducting in my PhD is mostly related to enhancing the performance of computer networks using Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Programmable Data Plane (PDP) switches. The main topic of my dissertation is a system that uses passive measurements from PDP switches to dynamically modify a router’s buffer size. The system sequentially solves an optimization problem to derive a buffer size that minimizes the queuing delays, and the packet loss rates. 

Through my research experience at the University of South Carolina, I continuously published in top conferences and journals and received more than 400 citations according to Google Scholar. I am an author (both main and co-author) of 20 conference papers, 7 journal papers, 2 workshop papers, and a book chapter. I am also the second author of a book entitled “High-Speed Networks: A Tutorial”, published by Springer. The book is being used nationally for deploying, troubleshooting, and tuning Science DMZ networks. <br>A full list of my publications can be accessed [here](/publications/).


Besides research, I have been teaching (instructor of record) in the Integrated Information Technology (IIT) department. The first course “ITEC 493: IT Security for Managers” provides students with a managerially focused overview of information security and how to effectively administer it. I redesigned the course contents and included extensive laboratories sessions. The second course “ITEC 445: Advanced Networking” covers network infrastructure topics (client/server protocols, routing, switching) with emphasis on hands-on implementations. The average student evaluation score of both courses is 4.74/5.0.
